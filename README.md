# proteosearch

A simple Python package which lets you programmatically run a few proteomics search engines (Comet, X! Tandem, MS-GF+) 
and use compiled Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) binaries without installing the entire pipeline.

TPP tools are run from a Singularity image (so an installation of Singularity is required).
